### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
As a highly skilled full stack web developer, I've honed my expertise in PHP (native, Laravel, Yii, CodeIgniter), Node.js, Express, Lua, Python, C#, VB, and VBA, as well as proficiency in Oracle SQL, SQL, and MySQL. My deep understanding of these technologies has allowed me to create innovative and cutting-edge products and services that meet and exceed customer expectations.

As a team leader, I have extensive experience managing projects and leading teams to success. Whether it's in the context of web development or other initiatives, I bring a wealth of knowledge and skill to the table, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my team's performance and drive growth.

Outside of my work as a developer and team leader, I'm also the director of M3LM Games, where I've spearheaded growth and transformational initiatives, completing over 100 projects for 3000 clients. Through my leadership, M3LM Games has become a pioneer in game mods, bringing innovation to the gaming experience.
